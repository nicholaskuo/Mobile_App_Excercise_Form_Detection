# Mobile_App_Excercise_Form_Detection
Jump is a React mobile application that is backed by a computer vision algorithm adept at body and joint detection. The application uses the phone camera to track the user’s joint movements and tempo when they do common gym exercises like bicep curls, shoulder presses, and squats. It also keeps an accurate track of how many reps the user does. Using a Twilio chatbot API, the application then provides personalized feedback on how to improve one’s exercise form based on the analyzed body angles and tempo, using machine learning to compare the user’s movements to videos of professional bodybuilders.

This is a Web app using computer vision to provide gym form correction with Twilio’s chatbot.
